# FyS Client : Free Tale

More details about the development of Free Tales is present on [my blog](http://freeyoursoul.online). 
This is a MMORPG with the server code [available here](https://github.com/FreeYourSoul/FyS). Server documentation provide more information about the game, story ect...

## Allegro

FyS Online client : Free Tales is based on [the library allegro5](https://github.com/liballeg/allegro5) which provide a good way to start a game project while still having a total control over the code base. Making me able to experiment as much as I want without having to care too much about the graphical details (which doesn't interest me for now).

## Assets
The asset used in Free Tale have been purchased through the unity store and are not mine to share. I didn't purchase a licence giving me the right to provide the sources of those assets. Thus the code and compilable version are (will be) provided through this repo.
